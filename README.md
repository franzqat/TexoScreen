# TexoScreen

TexoScreen is a program that allows the user to create small textboxes on the screen.

# How it works:
In the input field you put the letter/symbol/word you want to evidence, then press Generate! button to generate a button with the label you put in input box.
Boxes are fully dragable and always on top.
Clear button allows to close ALL buttons at the same time.

Distance button allows to separate the boxes with the distance number put in the next box. Distance is in pixel.

Quickbutton allows to quickly generate a series of textboxes. All you have to do is to separate the content of the single box with commas.

Box Size button allows to change the size of textboxes with values W - Width, H - Height, both in px.

For suggestions don't hesitate to contact.
